        ParaDRAM - NOTE: ndim is a 32-bit positive integer, representing the number of dimensions of the domain of the objective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: function. It is the only simulation specification variable that the user must always provide along 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: with the objective function, separately from the rest of the simulation specifications. The variable 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: ndim must be always provided directly to the ParaMonte routines, along with the objective function. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: If specified within an input file, its value will be ignored and not used. The variable ndim has no 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: default value as it is the only mandatory piece of information that must be provided by the user.
 
 

description

        UNDEFINED
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The variable 'description' contains general information about the specific ParaDRAM simulation that 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: is going to be performed. It has no effects on the simulation and serves only as a general description 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: of the simulation for future reference. The ParaDRAM parser automatically recognizes the C-style '\n' 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: escape sequence as the new-line character, and '\\' as the backslash character '\' if they used in 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the description. For example, '\\n' will be converted to '\n' on the output, while '\n' translates 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: to the new-line character. Other C escape sequences are neither supported nor needed. The default 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: value for description is 'UNDEFINED'.

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: simulation specification assignments from within the programming language environment (if any are

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: will be automatically assigned a default name. The default value is 'SampleVariablei' where integer 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 'i' is the index of the variable.
 
 

parallelizationModel

        singleChain
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: parallelizationModel is a string variable that represents the parallelization method to be used in 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: ParaDRAM. The string value must be enclosed by either single or double quotation marks when provided 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: as input. Two options are currently supported:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     parallelizationModel = 'multiChain'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This method uses the Prefect Parallelism scheme in which multiple MCMC chains are generated 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             independently of each other. In this case, multiple output MCMC chain files will also be 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             generated.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     parallelizationModel = 'singleChain'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This method uses the fork-style parallelization scheme. A single MCMC chain file will be 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             generated in this case. At each MCMC step multiple proposal steps will be checked in 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             parallel until one proposal is accepted.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Note that in serial mode, there is no parallelism. Therefore, this option does not affect non-parallel 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: simulations and its value is ignored. The serial mode is equivalent to either of the parallelism 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: methods with only one simulation image (processor, core, or thread). The default value is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: parallelizationModel = 'singleChain'. Note that the input values are case-insensitive and white-space 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: characters are ignored.
 
 

mpiFinalizeRequested

        T
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: In parallel ParaDRAM simulations via MPI communication libraries, if mpiFinalizeRequested = true (or 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: T, both case-insensitive), then a call will be made to the MPI_Finalize() routine from inside ParaDRAM 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: at the end of the simulation to finalize the MPI communications. Set this variable to false (or f, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: both case-insensitive) if you do not want ParaDRAM to finalize the MPI communications for you. This 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: is a low-level simulation specification variable, relevant to simulations that directly involve MPI 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: parallelism. If you do not have any MPI-routine calls in your main program, you can safely ignore 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: this variable with its default value. Note that in non-MPI-enabled simulations, such as serial and 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Coarray-enabled simulations, the value of this variable is completely ignored. The default value is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: TRUE.
 
 

outputFileName

        ./out/mvn_serial
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: outputFileName contains the path and the base of the filename for ParaDRAM output files. If not 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: provided by the user, the default outputFileName is constructed from the current date and time:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     ParaDRAM_run_yyyymmdd_hhmmss_mmm
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: where yyyy, mm, dd, hh, mm, ss, mmm stand respectively for the current year, month, day, hour, minute, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: second, and millisecond. In such a case, the default directory for the output files will be the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: current working directory of ParaDRAM. If outputFileName is provided, but ends with a separator 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: character '/' or '\' (as in Linux or Windows OS), then its value will be used as the directory to 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: which ParaDRAM output files will be written. In this case, the output file naming convention described 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: above will be used. Also, the given directory will be automatically created if it does not exist 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: already.
 
 

overwriteRequested

        T
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: A logical (boolean) variable. If true (or .true. or TRUE or .t. from within an input file), then any 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: existing old simulation files with the same name as the current simulation will be overwritten with 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the new simulation output files. Note that if overwriteRequested is set to TRUE, then the restart 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: functionality is automatically turned off and any existing old simulation output files with the same 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: name as the current simulation will be overwritten by ParaDRAM. The default value is FALSE.
 
 

targetAcceptanceRate

        UNDEFINED
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: targetAcceptanceRate sets an optimal target for the ratio of the number of accepted objective function 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: calls to the total number of function calls by the ParaDRAM sampler. It is a real-valued array of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: length 2, whose elements determine the upper and lower bounds of the desired acceptance rate. When 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the acceptance rate of the sampler is outside the specified limits, the sampler's settings will be 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: automatically adjusted to bring the overall acceptance rate to within the specified limits by the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: input variable targetAcceptanceRate. When assigned from within a dynamic-language programming 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: environment, such as MATLAB or Python, or from within an input file, targetAcceptanceRate can also 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: be a single real number between 0 and 1. In such case, the ParaDRAM sampler will constantly attempt 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: (with no guarantee of success) to bring the average acceptance ratio of the sampler as close to the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: user-provided target ratio as possible. The success of ParaDRAM in keeping the average acceptance 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: ratio close to the requested target value depends heavily on:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     1) the value of adaptiveUpdatePeriod; the larger, the easier.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     2) the value of adaptiveUpdateCount; the larger, the easier.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Note that the acceptance ratio adjustments will only occur every adaptiveUpdatePeriod sampling steps 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: for a total number of adaptiveUpdateCount. There is no default value for targetAcceptanceRate, as 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the acceptance ratio is not directly adjusted during sampling.
 
 

sampleSize

        -1
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The variable sampleSize is an integer that dictates the number of (hopefully, independent and 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: identically distributed [i.i.d.]) samples to be drawn from the user-provided objective function. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Three ranges of values are possible. If
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleSize < 0,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             then, the absolute value of sampleSize dictates the sample size in units of the effective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             sample size. The effective sample is by definition i.i.d., and free from duplicates and 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             residual autocorrelation. The effective sample size is automatically determined by ParaDRAM 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             toward the end of the simulation. For example:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:                     sampleSize = -1 yields the effective i.i.d. sample drawn from the objective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:                     function.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:                     sampleSize = -2 yields a (potentially non-i.i.d.) sample twice as big as the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:                     effective sample.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleSize > 0,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             then, the sample size is assumed to be in units of the number of points to be sampled. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             If sampleSize turns out to be less than effectiveSampleSize, the resulting sample will 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             be i.i.d.. If sampleSize turns out to be larger than effectiveSampleSize, the resulting 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             sample will be potentially non-i.i.d.. The larger this difference, the more non-i.i.d. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the resulting final refined sample will be. For example:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:                     sampleSize = 1000 yields a 1000-points sample from the objective function.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleSize = 0,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             then, no sample file will be generated.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The default value is sampleSize = -1.

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: vary from one simulation to another. However, enough care has been taken to assign unique random seed 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: values to the random number generator on each of the parallel threads (or images, processors, cores, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: ...) at all circumstances.
 
 

outputColumnWidth

        0
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The variable outputColumnWidth is a non-negative integer number that determines the width of the data 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: columns in ParaDRAM formatted output files that have tabular structure. If it is set to zero, ParaDRAM 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: will ensure to set the width of each output element to the minimum possible width without losing the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: requested output precision. In other words, setting outputColumnWidth = 0 will result in the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: smallest-size for the formatted output files that are in ASCII format. The default value is 0.
 
 

outputDelimiter

        ,
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: outputDelimiter is a string variable, containing a sequence of one or more characters (excluding 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: digits, the period symbol '.', and the addition and subtraction operators: '+' and '-'), that is used 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: to specify the boundary between separate, independent information elements in the tabular output 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: files of ParaDRAM. The string value must be enclosed by either single or double quotation marks when 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: provided as input. To output in Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) format, set outputDelimiter = ','. If 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the input value is not provided, the default delimiter ',' will be used when input outputColumnWidth 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: = 0, and a single space character, ',' will be used when input outputColumnWidth > 0. A value of '\t' 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: is interpreted as the TAB character. To avoid this interpretation, use '\\t' to yield '\t' without 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: being interpreted as the TAB character. The default value is ','.
 
 

outputRealPrecision

        8
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The variable outputRealPrecision is a 32-bit integer number that determines the precision - that is, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the number of significant digits - of the real numbers in the output files of ParaDRAM. Any positive 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: integer is acceptable as the input value of outputRealPrecision. However, any digits of the output 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: real numbers beyond the accuracy of 64-bit real numbers (approximately 16 digits of significance) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: will be meaningless and random. Set this variable to 16 (or larger) if full reproducibility of the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: simulation is needed in the future. But keep in mind that larger precisions will result in larger-size 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: output files. This variable is ignored for binary output (if any occurs during the simulation). The 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: default value is 8.
 
 

chainFileFormat

        compact
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: chainFileFormat is a string variable that represents the format of the output chain file(s) of ParaDRAM 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: simulation. The string value must be enclosed by either single or double quotation marks when provided 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: as input. Three values are possible:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     chainFileFormat = 'compact'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the ASCII (text) file format which is human-readable but does not preserve the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             full accuracy of the output values. It is also a significantly slower mode of chain file 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             generation, compared to the binary file format (see below). If the compact format is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             specified, each of the repeating MCMC states will be condensed into a single entry (row) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             in the output MCMC chain file. Each entry will be then assigned a sample-weight that is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             equal to the number of repetitions of that state in the MCMC chain. Thus, each row in 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the output chain file will represent a unique sample from the objective function. This 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             will lead to a significantly smaller ASCII chain file and faster output size compared to 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the verbose chain file format (see below).
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     chainFileFormat = 'verbose'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the ASCII (text) file format which is human-readable but does not preserve the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             full accuracy of the output values. It is also a significantly slower mode of chain file 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             generation, compared to both compact and binary chain file formats (see above and below). 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             If the verbose format is specified, all MCMC states will have equal sample-weights of 1 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             in the output chain file. The verbose format can lead to much larger chain file sizes 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             than the compact and binary file formats. This is especially true if the target objective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             function has a very high-dimensional state space.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     chainFileFormat = 'binary'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the binary file format which is not human-readable, but preserves the exact values 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             in the output MCMC chain file. It is also often the fastest mode of chain file generation. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             If the binary file format is chosen, the chain will be automatically output in the compact 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             format (but as binary) to ensure the production of the smallest-possible output chain 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             file. Binary chain files will have the .bin file extensions. Use the binary format if 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             you need full accuracy representation of the output values while having the smallest-size 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             output chain file in the shortest time possible.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The default value is chainFileFormat = 'compact' as it provides a reasonable trade-off between speed 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: and output file size while generating human-readable chain file contents. Note that the input values 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: are case-insensitive.
 
 

restartFileFormat

        binary
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: restartFileFormat is a string variable that represents the format of the output restart file(s) which 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: are used to restart an interrupted ParaDRAM simulation. The string value must be enclosed by either 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: single or double quotation marks when provided as input. Two values are possible:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     restartFileFormat = 'binary'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the binary file format which is not human-readable, but preserves the exact values 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             of the specification variables required for the simulation restart. This full accuracy 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             representation is required to exactly reproduce an interrupted simulation. The binary 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             format is also normally the fastest mode of restart file generation. Binary restart files 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             will have the .bin file extensions.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     restartFileFormat = 'ASCII'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the ASCII (text) file format which is human-readable but does not preserve the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             full accuracy of the specification variables required for the simulation restart. It is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             also a significantly slower mode of restart file generation, compared to the binary 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             format. Therefore, its usage should be limited to situations where the user wants to 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             track the dynamics of simulation specifications throughout the simulation time. ASCII 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             restart file(s) will have the .txt file extensions.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The default value is restartFileFormat = 'binary'. Note that the input values are case-insensitive.
 
 

progressReportPeriod

        1000
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Every progressReportPeriod calls to the objective function, the sampling progress will be reported 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: to the log file. Note that progressReportPeriod must be a positive integer. The default value is 1000.
 
 

maxNumDomainCheckToWarn

        1000
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: maxNumDomainCheckToWarn is an integer number beyond which the user will be warned about the newly-proposed 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: points being excessively proposed outside the domain of the objective function. For every 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: maxNumDomainCheckToWarn consecutively-proposed new points that fall outside the domain of the objective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: function, the user will be warned until maxNumDomainCheckToWarn = maxNumDomainCheckToStop, in which 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: case the sampler returns a fatal error and the program stops globally. The counter for this warning 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: message is reset after a proposal sample from within the domain of the objective function is obtained. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: When out-of-domain sampling happens frequently, it is a strong indication of something fundamentally 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: wrong in the simulation. It is, therefore, important to closely inspect and monitor for such frequent 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: out-of-domain samplings. This can be done by setting maxNumDomainCheckToWarn to an appropriate value 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: determined by the user. The default value is 1000.
 
 

maxNumDomainCheckToStop

        10000
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: maxNumDomainCheckToStop is an integer number beyond which the program will stop globally with a fatal 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: error message declaring that the maximum number of proposal-out-of-domain-bounds has reached. The 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: counter for this global-stop request is reset after a proposal point is accepted as a sample from 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: within the domain of the objective function. When out-of-domain sampling happens frequently, it is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: a strong indication of something fundamentally wrong in the simulation. It is, therefore, important 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: to closely inspect and monitor for such frequent out-of-domain samplings. This can be done by setting 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: maxNumDomainCheckToStop to an appropriate value determined by the user. The default value is 10000.
 
 

chainSize

        100000
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: chainSize determines the number of non-refined, potentially auto-correlated, but unique, samples 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: drawn by the MCMC sampler before stopping ParaDRAM. For example, if you specify chainSize = 10000, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: then 10000 unique sample points (with no duplicates) will be drawn from the target objective function 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: that the user has provided. The input value for chainSize must be a positive integer of a minimum 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: value ndim+1 or larger, where ndim is the number of variables that define the domain of the objective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: function to be sampled. The default value is 100000.

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec represents the lower boundaries of the cubical domain from which 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the starting point(s) of the MCMC chain(s) will be initialized randomly (only if requested via the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: input variable randomStartPointRequested. This happens only when some or all of the elements of the

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: be set to the center point between RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec and RandomStartPointDomainUpperLimit 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: in the corresponding dimension. If RandomStartPointRequested=TRUE (or True, true, t, all case-insensitive), 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: then the missing elements of StartPoint will be initialized to values drawn randomly from within the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: corresponding ranges specified by the input variable RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec. As an input 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: variable, RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec is an ndim-dimensional vector of 64-bit real numbers, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: where ndim is the number of variables of the objective function. It is also possible to assign only 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: select values of RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec and leave the rest of the components to be 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: assigned the default value. This is POSSIBLE ONLY when RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec is defined 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: inside the input file to ParaDRAM. For example, having the following inside the input file, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     RandomStartPointDomainLowerLimitVec(3:5) = -100
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: startPointVec is a 64bit real-valued vector of length ndim (the dimension of the domain of the input

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: A logical (boolean) variable. If true (or .true. or TRUE or .t. from within an input file), then the

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: given by RandomStartPointDomain variable. Note that the value of startPointVec, if provided, has 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: precedence over random initialization. In other words, for every element of startPointVec that is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: not provided as input only that element will initialized randomly if randomStartPointRequested=TRUE. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Also, note that even if startPointVec is randomly initialized, its random value will be deterministic

sampleRefinementCount

        1073741823
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: When sampleSize < 0, the integer variable sampleRefinementCount dictates the maximum number of times 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the MCMC chain will be refined to remove the autocorrelation within the output MCMC sample. For 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: example,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     if sampleRefinementCount = 0,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             no refinement of the output MCMC chain will be performed, the resulting MCMC sample will 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             simply correspond to the full MCMC chain in verbose format (i.e., each sampled state has 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             a weight of one).
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     if sampleRefinementCount = 1,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the refinement of the output MCMC chain will be done only once if needed, and no more, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             even though there may still exist some residual autocorrelation in the output MCMC sample. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             In practice, only one refinement of the final output MCMC Chain should be enough to remove 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the existing autocorrelations in the final output sample. Exceptions occur when the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             Integrated Autocorrelation (IAC) of the output MCMC chain is comparable to or larger than 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the length of the chain. In such cases, neither the BatchMeans method nor any other method 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             of IAC computation will be able to accurately compute the IAC. Consequently, the samples 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             generated based on the computed IAC values will likely not be i.i.d. and will still be 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             significantly autocorrelated. In such scenarios, more than one refinement of the MCMC 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             chain will be necessary. Very small sample size resulting from multiple refinements of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the sample could be a strong indication of the bad mixing of the MCMC chain and the output 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             chain may not contain true i.i.d. samples from the target objective function.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     if sampleRefinementCount > 1,
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the refinement of the output MCMC chain will be done for a maximum sampleRefinementCount 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             number of times, even though there may still exist some residual autocorrelation in the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             final output MCMC sample.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     if sampleRefinementCount >> 1 (e.g., comparable to or larger than the length of the MCMC chain),
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the refinement of the output MCMC chain will continue until the integrated autocorrelation 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             of the resulting final sample is less than 2, virtually implying that an independent 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             identically-distributed (i.i.d.) sample has finally been obtained.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Note that to obtain i.i.d. samples from a multidimensional chain, ParaDRAM will, by default, use the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: maximum of Integrated Autocorrelation (IAC) among all dimensions of the chain to refine the chain. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Note that the value specified for sampleRefinementCount is used only when the variable sampleSize < 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 0, otherwise, it will be ignored. The default value is sampleRefinementCount = 1073741823.
 
 

sampleRefinementMethod

        BatchMeans
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: sampleRefinementMethod is a string variable that represents the method of computing the Integrated 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Autocorrelation Time (IAC) to be used in ParaDRAM for refining the final output MCMC chain and sample. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The string value must be enclosed by either single or double quotation marks when provided as input. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Options that are currently supported include:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This method of computing the Integrated Autocorrelation Time is based on the approach 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             described in SCHMEISER, B., 1982, Batch size effects in the analysis of simulation output, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             Oper. Res. 30 556-568. The batch sizes in the BatchMeans method are chosen to be int(N^(2/3)) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             where N is the length of the MCMC chain. As long as the batch size is larger than the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             IAC of the chain and there are significantly more than 10 batches, the BatchMeans method 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             will provide reliable estimates of the IAC. Note that the refinement strategy involves 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             two separate phases of sample decorrelation. At the first stage, the Markov chain is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             decorrelated recursively (for as long as needed) based on the IAC of its compact format, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             where only the the uniquely-visited states are kept in the (compact) chain. Once the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             Markov chain is refined such that its compact format is fully decorrelated, the second 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             phase of the decorrelation begins during which the Markov chain is decorrelated based on 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the IAC of the chain in its verbose (Markov) format. This process is repeated recursively 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             for as long as there is any residual autocorrelation in the refined sample.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans-compact'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the same as the first case in the above, except that only the first phase of the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             sample refinement described in the above will be performed, that is, the (verbose) Markov 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             chain is refined only based on the IAC computed from the compact format of the Markov 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             chain. This will lead to a larger final refined sample. However, the final sample will 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             likely not be fully decorrelated.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans-verbose'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is the same as the first case in the above, except that only the second phase of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the sample refinement described in the above will be performed, that is, the (verbose) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             Markov chain is refined only based on the IAC computed from the verbose format of the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             Markov chain. While the resulting refined sample will be fully decorrelated, the size of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             the refined sample may be smaller than the default choice in the first case in the above.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Note that in order to obtain i.i.d. samples from a multidimensional chain, ParaDRAM will use the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: average of IAC among all dimensions of the chain to refine the chain. If the maximum, minimum, or 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the median of IACs is preferred add '-max' (or '-maximum'), '-min' (or '-minimum'), '-med' (or 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: '-median'), respectively, to the value of sampleRefinementMethod. For example, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans-max'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: or, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans-compact-max'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: or, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans-max-compact'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Also, note that the value specified for sampleRefinementCount is used only when the variable sampleSize 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: < 0, otherwise, it will be ignored. The default value is sampleRefinementMethod = 'BatchMeans'. Note 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: that the input values are case-insensitive and white-space characters are ignored.
 
 

scaleFactor

        gelman
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: scaleFactor is a real-valued positive number (which must be given as string), by the square of which 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the covariance matrix of the proposal distribution of the MCMC sampler is scaled. In other words, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the proposal distribution will be scaled in every direction by the value of scaleFactor. It can also 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: be given in units of the string keyword 'gelman' (which is case-INsensitive) after the paper:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     Gelman, Roberts, and Gilks (1996): 'Efficient Metropolis Jumping Rules'.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: The paper finds that the optimal scaling factor for a Multivariate Gaussian proposal distribution 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: for the Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of a target Multivariate Normal 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Distribution of dimension ndim is given by:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = 2.38/sqrt(ndim)  ,  in the limit of ndim -> Infinity.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Multiples of the gelman scale factors are also acceptable as input and can be specified like the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: following examples:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = '1'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             multiplies the ndim-dimensional proposal covariance matrix by 1, essentially no change 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             occurs to the covariance matrix.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = "1"
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             same as the previous example. The double-quotation marks act the same way as single-quotation 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             marks.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = '2.5'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             multiplies the ndim-dimensional proposal covariance matrix by 2.5.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = '2.5*Gelman'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             multiplies the ndim-dimensional proposal covariance matrix by 2.5 * 2.38/sqrt(ndim).
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = "2.5 * gelman"
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             same as the previous example, but with double-quotation marks. space characters are 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             ignored.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     scaleFactor = "2.5 * gelman*gelman*2"
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             equivalent to gelmanFactor-squared multiplied by 5.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Note, however, that the result of Gelman et al. paper applies only to multivariate normal proposal 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: distributions, in the limit of infinite dimensions. Therefore, care must be taken when using Gelman's 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: scaling factor with non-Gaussian proposals and target objective functions. Note that only the product 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: symbol (*) can be parsed in the string value of scaleFactor. The presence of other mathematical 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: symbols or multiple appearances of the product symbol will lead to a simulation crash. Also, note 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: that the prescription of an acceptance range specified by the input variable 'targetAcceptanceRate' 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: will lead to dynamic modification of the initial input value of scaleFactor throughout sampling for 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: adaptiveUpdateCount times. The default scaleFactor string-value is 'gelman' (for all proposals), 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: which is subsequently converted to 2.38/sqrt(ndim).
 
 

proposalModel

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: proposalModel is a string variable containing the name of the proposal distribution for the MCMC 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: sampler. The string value must be enclosed by either single or double quotation marks when provided 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: as input. One option is currently supported:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     proposalModel = 'normal'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             This is equivalent to the multivariate normal distribution, which is the most widely-used 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             proposal model along with MCMC samplers.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     proposalModel = 'uniform'
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             The proposals will be drawn uniformly from within a ndim-dimensional ellipsoid whose 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             covariance matrix and scale are initialized by the user and optionally adaptively updated 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             throughout the simulation.

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: proposalStartCorMat is a real-valued positive-definite matrix of size (ndim,ndim), where ndim is the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: dimension of the sampling space. It serves as the best-guess starting correlation matrix of the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: proposal distribution used by ParaDRAM. It is used (along with the input vector ProposalStartStdVec) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: to construct the covariance matrix of the proposal distribution when the input covariance matrix is 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: missing in the input list of variables. If the covariance matrix is given as input to ParaDRAM, any 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: input values for proposalStartCorMat, as well as ProposalStartStdVec, will be automatically ignored 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: by ParaDRAM. As input to ParaDRAM, the variable proposalStartCorMat along with ProposalStartStdVec 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: is especially useful in situations where obtaining the best-guess covariance matrix is not trivial.

        ParaDRAM - NOTE: requested schedule. If proposalStartCovMat is not provided by the user or it is completely missing 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: from the input file, its value will be automatically computed via the input variables proposalStartCorMat 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: and proposalStartStdVec (or via their default values, if not provided). The default value of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: proposalStartCovMat is an ndim-by-ndim Identity matrix.
 
 

adaptiveUpdatePeriod

        88
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Every adaptiveUpdatePeriod calls to the objective function, the parameters of the proposal distribution 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: will be updated. The variable adaptiveUpdatePeriod must be a positive integer (>0). The smaller the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: value of adaptiveUpdatePeriod, the easier it will be for the ParaDRAM kernel to adapt the proposal 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: distribution to the covariance structure of the objective function. However, this will happen at the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: expense of slower simulation runtime as the adaptation process can become computationally expensive, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: in particular, for very high dimensional objective functions (ndim>>1). The larger the value of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: adaptiveUpdatePeriod, the easier it will be for the ParaDRAM kernel to keep the sampling efficiency 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: close to the requested target acceptance rate range (if specified via the input variable 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: targetAcceptanceRate). However, too large values for adaptiveUpdatePeriod will only delay the adaptation 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: of the proposal distribution to the global structure of the objective function that is being sampled. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: If adaptiveUpdatePeriod>=chainSize, then no adaptive updates to the proposal distribution will be 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: made. The default value is 4 * ndim, where ndim is the dimension of the domain of the objective 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: function to be sampled. In this particular ParaDRAM simulation, this corresponds to the value 88.
 
 

adaptiveUpdateCount

        1073741823
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: adaptiveUpdateCount represents the total number of adaptive updates that will be made to the parameters 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: of the proposal distribution to increase the efficiency of the sampler thus increasing the overall 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: sampling efficiency of ParaDRAM. Every adaptiveUpdatePeriod number of calls to the objective function, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the parameters of the proposal distribution will be updated until either the total number of adaptive 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: updates reaches the value of adaptiveUpdateCount. This variable must be a non-negative integer. As 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: a rule of thumb, it may be appropriate to set the input variable chainSize > 2 * adaptiveUpdatePeriod 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: * adaptiveUpdateCount, to ensure ergodicity and stationarity of the MCMC sampler. If adaptiveUpdateCount=0, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: then the proposal distribution parameters will be fixed to the initial input values throughout the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: entire MCMC sampling. The default value is 1073741823.
 
 

greedyAdaptationCount

        0
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: If greedyAdaptationCount is set to a positive integer then the first greedyAdaptationCount number of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the adaptive updates of the sampler will be made using only the 'unique' accepted points in the MCMC 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: chain. This is useful, for example, when the function to be sampled by ParaDRAM is high dimensional, 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: in which case, the adaptive updates to ParaDRAM's sampler distribution will less likely lead to 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: numerical instabilities, for example, a singular covariance matrix for the multivariate proposal 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: sampler. The variable greedyAdaptationCount must be a non-negative integer, and not larger than the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: value of adaptiveUpdateCount. If it is larger, it will be automatically set to adaptiveUpdateCount 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: for the simulation. The default value is 0.
 
 

burninAdaptationMeasure

        1.000000000000000
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: burninAdaptationMeasure is a 64-bit real number between 0 and 1, representing the adaptation measure 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: threshold below which the simulated Markov chain will be used to generate the output ParaDRAM sample. 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: In other words, any point in the output Markov Chain that has been sampled during significant adaptation 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: of the proposal distribution (as determined by burninAdaptationMeasure) will not be included in the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: construction of the final ParaDRAM output sample. This is to ensure that the generation of the output 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: sample will be based on the part of the simulated chain that is practically guaranteed to be Markovian 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: and ergodic. If this variable is set to 0, then the output sample will be generated from the part of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the chain where no proposal adaptation has occurred. This non-adaptive or minimally-adaptive part of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: the chain may not even exist if the total adaptation period of the simulation (as determined by 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: adaptiveUpdateCount and adaptiveUpdatePeriod input variables) is longer than the total length of the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: output MCMC chain. In such cases, the resulting output sample may have a zero size. In general, when 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: good mixing occurs (e.g., when the input variable chainSize is very large) any specific value of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: burninAdaptationMeasure becomes practically irrelevant. The default value for burninAdaptationMeasure 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: is 1.00000000000000, implying that the entire chain (with the exclusion of an initial automatically-determined 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: burnin period) will be used to generate the final output sample.
 
 

delayedRejectionCount

        0
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 0 <= delayedRejectionCount <= 1000 is an integer that represents the total number of stages for which 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: rejections of new proposals will be tolerated by ParaDRAM before going back to the previously accepted 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: point (state). Possible values are:
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     delayedRejectionCount = 0
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             indicating no deployment of the delayed rejection algorithm.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:     delayedRejectionCount > 0
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE:             which implies a maximum delayedRejectionCount number of rejections will be tolerated.
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: For example, delayedRejectionCount = 1, means that at any point during the sampling, if a proposal 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: is rejected, ParaDRAM will not go back to the last sampled state. Instead, it will continue to propose 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: a new state from the last rejected proposal. If the new state is again rejected based on the rules 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: of ParaDRAM, then the algorithm will not tolerate further rejections, because the maximum number of 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: rejections to be tolerated has been set by the user to be delayedRejectionCount = 1. The algorithm 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: then goes back to the original last-accepted state and will begin proposing new states from that 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: location. The default value is delayedRejectionCount = 0.
 
 

delayedRejectionScaleFactorVec

        UNDEFINED
 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: delayedRejectionScaleFactorVec is a real-valued positive vector of length (1:delayedRejectionCount) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: by which the covariance matrix of the proposal distribution of ParaDRAM sampler is scaled when the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: Delayed Rejection (DR) scheme is activated (by setting delayedRejectionCount>0). At each ith stage 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: of the DR process, the proposal distribution from the last stage is scaled by the factor 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: delayedRejectionScaleFactorVec(i). Missing elements of the delayedRejectionScaleFactorVec in the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: input to ParaDRAM will be set to the default value. The default value at all stages is 0.5^(1/ndim) 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: = 0.968984473901262, which reduces the volume of the covariance matrix of the proposal from the last 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: DR stage by one half. The variable ndim represents the number of dimensions of the Domain of the 
        ParaDRAM - NOTE: objective function.
